# Transformer implementation
My implementation of the transformer architecture from the paper [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

# Why an another implementation?

I made this code to learn the basis of pytorch and practice my skill in deep learning. There are a lot of chance that the implementation is wrong so I do not recommend using it, it's just a student project.

# Training

You just have to follow this two steps

1. Install modules:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run the training script: `python3 train.py`
